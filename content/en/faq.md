## How do I purchase a license for my entire team?

You can purchase a license that you can share with your entire team for $260 USD on CodeCanyon.

For more information on team licensing specifics, read through [our license](/license#team-license). If you have any question don't hesitate to contact us through support@intenseloop.com

## What does "unlimited projects" mean?

Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new Firetask license every time you want to use it on a new project.

As long as what you're building will be owned by the Firetask license holder, you can build as many sites as you want without ever having to buy an additional license.

For more information and examples, [our license](/license)

## What does "free updates" include?

We're planning to add new features and components regularly over time and all new components added will be totally free for existing customers. We may work on new features/component "kits" in the future that would be sold separately (eg: admin systems, dashboards, backend jobs, etc) but any components we design and build that belong into an existing kit will always be added as a free update for everyone who has bought that kit.

## What JS framework does Firetask use?

In order to be as universal as possible, Firetask is built on top of Angular and Ionic. But it also exports web components to serve as an HTML-only component library making it easy to integrate on every existing framework, or even in pure javascript. You can check implementation examples in here. To get a better idea of how this would work in an angular scenario, please check out our documentation.

## Can I sell templates/themes I build with Firetask?

No, you cannot use Firetask to create derivative products like themes, UI kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and redistributing our components for someone else to use to build their own apps. For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our license](/license).

## Can I use Firetask for my own commercial projects?

Absolutely yes! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own projects as you like, whether those are simple public websites, SaaS or app applications that end users need to pay to access.
For more information and examples, [read through our license](/license).

## Can I use Firetask in open source projects?

No! You're not allowed to build or redistribute any piece of Firetask as open-source.
For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our license](/license).

## What browsers does Firetask support?

The components in Firetask are designed to work in the latest, stable releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. We don't support Internet Explorer 11.

## What is your refund policy?

If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at support@Firetask.app within 7 days and we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.
