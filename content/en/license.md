## Standard License

### Definitions

- Licensee is the individual who has purchased a Standard License.

- Components are the whole set of features which structures the app. It may include the components itself (html + css + js), redux paradigms, effects, seeds, etc. In other words, all the source code made available to the Licensee after purchasing a Firetask license.

- End Product is any artifact produced that incorporates the Components or derivatives of the Components.

- End User is a user of an End Product.

- Client is an individual or entity receiving professional services from the Licensee.

Intenseloop Inc. grants you an on-going, non-exclusive license to use the Components.

The license grants permission to **one individual** (the Licensee) to access and use the Components.

You **can**:

- Use the Components to create unlimited End Products.
- Modify the Components to create derivative components. Those components are subject to this license.
- Use the Components to create unlimited End Products for unlimited Clients.
- Use the Components to create End Products where the End Product is sold to End Users.

You **cannot**:

- Use the Components to create End Products that are designed to allow an End User to build their own End Products using the Components or derivatives of the Components.
- Re-distribute the Components or derivatives of the Components separately from an End Product, neither in code or as design assets.
- Share your access to the Components with any other individuals
- Use the Components to create End Products that are open source and freely available to End Users.

### Example usage

#### Examples of usage **allowed** by the license:

- Creating a personal website by yourself
- Creating a website or app for a client that will be owned by that client
- Creating a commercial SaaS application (like an invoicing app for example) where end users have to pay a fee to use the application
- Creating a commercial self-hosted app that is sold to end users for an one-time fee

#### Examples of usage **not allowed** by the license:

- Creating a repository of your favorite Firetask components (or derivatives) and publishing it publicly
- Creating a React or Vue version of Firetask and making it available either for sale or for free
- Create a Figma or Sketch UI kit based on the Firetask component designs
- Creating a "website builder" project where end users can build their own websites/application using components included with or derived from Firetask
- Creating a theme, template, or project starter kit using the components and making it available either for sale or for free
- Creating an admin panel tool (like Laravel Nova or ActiveAdmin) that is made available either for sale or for free
- Creating an app where the primary purpose is clearly to simply re-distribute the components (like a conference organization app that uses the components for its UI/UX for example) that is free and open source, where the source code is publicly available

In simple terms, use Firetask for anything you like <u>except for projects that compete with Firetask and would have a negative impact on our product sales</u> ✌️
