Navigate to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase site</a> and once logged in create a new project

![create firebase project](/images/docs/firebase-create-project.png)

<alert>

Google may ask to enable Analytics, this is not required by Firetask. You can disable this option as to make Analytics work you would need more than this simple opt-in. In the future if you need Analytics capabilities we recommend the use of [Firebase Analytics Plugin](https://github.com/capacitor-community/firebase-analytics)

</alert>

## Enable email provider

Once your new project is ready navigate to `Authentication` from menu and enable auth for Email/Password. For the very first access you may have to click on `Get Started` so you can see the screen as below.

Once asked enable only the option `Allow users to sign up using their email address and password. Our SDKs also provide email address verification, password recovery, and email address change primitives.`

## Activate Firestore

Then navigate to `Cloud Firestore` from menu to create a new database and you should be set to continue the setup

When asked you can start database in _production mode_ since we're going to modify these settings further up
