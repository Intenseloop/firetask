<alert>

The root folder is the one containing files like **package.json**, **angular.json** and **capacitor.config.json**. Once you extract the zip, just cd to **firetask-app-x.y.z/firetask**. Everything asked you to execute from now on will require your current working directory to be the app root.

</alert>

Issue `npm install` to install all the project dependencies before continuing.
