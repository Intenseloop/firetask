Now we need to link the app with Firestore so we can easily deploy our indexes and rules

```sh
firebase init firestore
```

This command will prompt a few questions

1. Select to _use an existing project_
2. Select the recently created project _my-app_
3. On `What file should be used for Firestore Rules?` press enter
4. On `File firestore.rules already exists. Do you want to overwrite` press N
5. On `What file should be used for Firestore indexes?` press enter
6. On `File firestore.indexes.json already exists. Do you want to overwrite` press N

Then CLI should generate 2 new files `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json` containing specific firebase configs.

## Deploy rules and indexes

Now we can safely deploy Firetask rules and indexes. These are going to be important for the seed step.

```sh
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes,firestore:rules
```
